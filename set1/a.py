Going hard-on while encouraging idea that a leaders's success entierly depends on welfare of his subjects viz.freedom,public,health.etc
could be dangerous stance to take.The person chosen to lead a country is expected to demonstarte unique,rare qualities--ability to see beyond the present scenario for one.
The effects and consequences of the actions and the laws rolled in are often long-term regardless of the general public opinion is.It is 
very rare that a leader is accepted and loved by all.while one of the primary requiremenets of fullfilling a leaders job is to able to bring significant improvements 
to a citizen weel beaing.There are many other asspects that come into picture beacuse prosperity and success are relative terms and are depedent on those other asspects.But,again if the common people of the country are leading a life is misnery,leadership
becomes ambigious.
Leaders,while having littel control over the general public opinion,can influence laws that can enforce the security of its citizens--strict traffic laws ensure safe drinking,Food and Drug Enforcement Administartion to keep a check on the food production and facilitate the betterment of nations oberall healthh among others.
Moreover,military plays vital role in ensuring the safety of nation's citizen againt intraders.Leaders accross the globe invest heavily on the armed forces,developing weaons,investing time and resources into the training the soldiers.Yet,this is often forgetten or rather taken for granted beacause we dont wittness it on daily basis.Also the prime minister or the president always be bothered by the troubles of evry fading minority or tribe,institution or an individual citizen.Hence it is safe to say that the term well beaing of the citizens is a subjective entity and depends on what is being judged


Measuring the impact the leaders has in the country while keeping the content of the subject,could prove to be a better parameter for the well being,overall
